    <p>A water tender is a fire truck that carries a lot of water to places where there are no fire hydrants nearby. It can take water from lakes or rivers. It helps other fire trucks by giving them more water. Sometimes it also carries firefighters and tools to help fight fires, especially in the countryside or forests.</p>
